            <p>Once, there was a father who used to play chess every evening</p>
            <p>This man had a daughter who was 10 years old</p>
            <p>When she turned 11, she asked her father to teach her play chess</p>
            <p>The man agreed and started telling her the rules</p>
            <p>The girl seemed to enjoy it so she learned everything pretty quickly</p>

        <div class="part-2">
           <p>When she prepared herself for the first game, she asked her father to join and practice with her</p>
           <p>Her father was pretty proud and so they started round 1.</p>
           <p>The game was though and her father would always win.</p>
           <p>But the girl never gave up.</p>
