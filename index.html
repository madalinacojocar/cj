        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>My name is <span class="bold">Cojocaru Madelina</span> and I'm a 10th grader.
        I learn in the theoretical lyceum "Orizont", and im am now doing my informatic assigment.
        That's why this site was created. I love sports and outdoors activities, i guess this is the reason why i'm not that good at it
        Spending time with kids and helping oters is my cyrrent hobby

        <h1>Skills</h1>
        <p>I'm really good at making 3D projects and I'm extremply good at sleeping.
            I'm good at real subjects like maths, but i have a lack of skill for social classes like history.
            buut... it is what it is and a i don't have to worry about it. I have language skills and i am a biligual person.
            Speaking english and romanian is mostly like a habbit, im also good a t russian and german. I have a lot more skills
            but there won't be enough space for me to write them all,so... Goodbye!
